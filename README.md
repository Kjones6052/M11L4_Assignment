# **Hello, World!**

The files contained in this repository are for my assignment React Routing and Single-Page Applications, Module 11 Lesson 4.


Overview:

For this assignment I created a brief application that uses Axios to make GET requests to the Marvel Comics API. The pages included are: Home 
Page, Browse Characters Page, Character Details Page, Comics Page, and a Not Found Page. The application also features a Navigation Bar with 
change effects applied to the Navigation Links. The Home Page and Comics pages are intentially left incomplete. The Navigation Bar includes a 
NavLink to a page that does not exist to show the use of the Not Found Page.
